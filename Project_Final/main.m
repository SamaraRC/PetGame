%This script will serve as the main script, calling on other functions for
%the running of this game.

%The aim of this project is to create a working pet care game
%The game must include: User Input and Output in MATLAB
%A visualisation of changing application state (this can be through a text representation of state (e.g. ASCII artLinks to an external site. used to show a current game board or histogram of current values) or plotting of current values in MATLAB).  
%MATLAB programming concepts including:
%Loops
%Vectors
%Matrices
%Conditional execution
%Functions
%Main involves elements of all development stages, so it will be my last to
%create test cases for.
