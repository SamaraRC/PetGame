# PetGame
This is one of my first year projects, where I created a tamagothi like pet care game :)

This project was helpful in my learning of functions and program orders in creating intercolaborate files (I'm sorry if I didn't word that very well).
Specifically, through this project I got to demonstrate my apptitude in using GUI, matricies, functions, loops, vectors, and conditional execution.
